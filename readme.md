## About The Project

<img src="/images/screenshot.png" alt="screen shot" width = "1000">

Welcome to our VRC Python Project! This document serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding our project. We've created this file with the aim of explaining how to control the robot as well as how to navigate this project.

## Built With

This project was made for the VEX  V5 Python system for robotics competitions.

## Getting Started

To apply this code to your robot you need a vs code editor with the vex extension installed.

### Prerequisites

* npm

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```
* git

```sh
npm install git
```
> For more information go to [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Forklift-Certified-10930C/vrc-python-app.git
```

2. Use the download and build button at the bottom of the screen to push to the robot.

## Usage

In the `main.py` file, you will find the code that controls the robot's movements, runs autonomous routines, and manages other important functions for the VEX Over Under competition. Use `git clone https://github.com/Forklift-Certified-10930C/vrc-python-app.git` to clone the repository with git
_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Forklift-Certfied-10930C/vrc-python-app/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
